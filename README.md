# 🌾 Capstone Project: Data-Driven Farming Business Analysis (Wheat & Paddy)

## 📌 Project Overview
This capstone project applies **data analysis and business decision-making (BDM)** techniques to help a small-scale farmer grow and optimize his farming business. The farmer cultivates two major crops—**wheat and paddy**—and the project focuses on understanding costs, yields, revenue, and profitability using real operational data.

Unlike hypothetical case studies, this project uses **primary data collected directly from the farmer**, enabling realistic analysis and actionable recommendations.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Analyze the farmer’s business performance using historical data
- Compare wheat and paddy in terms of **cost, yield, and profitability**
- Identify inefficiencies and cost drivers
- Answer practical business questions raised by the farmer
- Provide **data-driven recommendations** to support better decision-making and farm growth

---

## 🧠 Business Decision Making (BDM) Focus
This project emphasizes **Business Decision Making**, not just technical analysis. Insights were used to:
- Evaluate which crop delivers better margins under current conditions
- Decide optimal crop allocation across seasons
- Improve resource usage (seeds, labor, water, fertilizers)
- Support planning decisions for future farming cycles

The goal was to convert raw data into **clear, actionable business insights** that a non-technical stakeholder (the farmer) can understand and use.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

### 🔹 Excel
- Initial data entry and validation
- Preliminary cleaning and summaries
- Cross-checking calculations and totals

### 🔹 Python
- **File handling** to manage and organize raw datasets
- Data analysis using **Pandas**
- Logical processing of farming records

### 🔹 Data Visualization
- **Matplotlib** for basic plots and trends
- **Seaborn** for comparative and statistical visualizations
- Visual analysis of cost patterns, yield trends, and profitability differences

## 📂 Data Description
The dataset includes real farming records such as:
- Crop type (wheat / paddy)
- Season and time period
- Input costs (seeds, labor, irrigation, fertilizers)
- Yield quantities
- Revenue and profit indicators

All data was collected directly from the farmer, ensuring authenticity and relevance.

---

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed
- Cost vs yield comparison for wheat and paddy
- Profitability analysis across seasons
- Trend analysis to identify performance changes over time
- Visualization of key metrics for easy interpretation
- Identification of loss-making or low-efficiency patterns

---

## 💡 Insights & Recommendations
- Highlighted which crop performs better under current cost structures
- Identified areas where costs can be controlled without reducing yield
- Suggested data-backed adjustments in crop planning and resource allocation
- Provided clear answers to the farmer’s business-related questions

These recommendations are **practical and grounded in data**, not theoretical.
